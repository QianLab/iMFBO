This is the repository for implementation of the paper **Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization with Multiple Information Sources of
Input-dependent Fidelity**, which accepted as a conference paper in UAI 2024 [link to be upload](https://www.auai.org/uai2024/).

Please check the `experiment` folder for runnable examplar code.

To utilize the code, one need to specify the target function, surrogate model used, acquisition function utilized and finally
specify the experiment class. In the `real_exp.py` we have an example code for running our models and the benchmarks.


For the required packages, please see the `requirement.txt` for the prerequisite packages or simply use 
>pip install requirements.txt
